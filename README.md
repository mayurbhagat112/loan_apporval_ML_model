Loan Approval Predictor

Overview
Loan Approval Predictor is an end-to-end Streamlit application that evaluates loan applications using a trained machine-learning model. Applicants enter their financial and demographic details through an intuitive web form, and the app returns an instant decision (“Approved” or “Rejected”) along with a probability score. Deployable on Streamlit Community Cloud (or any Streamlit-compatible host), this tool makes it easy for fintech teams to prototype, demo, or productionize automated credit-decision workflows.

Key Features

Interactive Input Form
Collects applicant details (e.g. income, credit history, loan amount, employment status) via Streamlit widgets.

Real-Time Predictions
Loads a serialized ML model (e.g. a Logistic Regression or Gradient Boosting Classifier) to compute approval likelihood instantly.

Probability & Explanation
Displays both the approval probability and a simple explanation dashboard (e.g. feature importances or SHAP summary) so users understand the “why” behind the decision.

Model Monitoring Stub
Logs inputs, predictions, and timestamps to a CSV or database stub for future performance tracking and retraining.

Easy Deployment
One-click deploy on Streamlit Community Cloud or via streamlit run on any server—no Docker or Kubernetes required.
